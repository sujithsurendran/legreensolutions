<b>How do we do?</b><br><br>

We have matured methods and practices for development over years of developments.<br>
<ul>
  <li> We take pain to learn your business. </li>
  <li>After considerable contemplation we arrive at the User Requirements Specification.</li>
  <li>This is an iterative process that is continued till user is satisfied with a working plan.</li>
  <li>Before starting we come to a meaningful time and cost schedule.</li>
  <li>We believe Design freeze is not the end of all.</li>
  <li>A frozen designs can always be thawed and put back to life if situation demands.</li>
  <li>To support this model of development we try to break down large systems in to small modules with individual milestones.</li>
  <li>Peer Testing, Module Testing, System Testing.</li>
  <li> User Acceptance</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>AJILE</b><br>
	Rails has strengthened the AJILE thinking.<br>
Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. The Agile Manifesto introduced the term in 2001.<br><br>

    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
    Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
    Responding to change over following a plan<br>
<br>
<b>Twelve principles underlie the Agile Manifesto </b>
<ul>
  <li>Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software</li>
  <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.</li>
  <li>Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)</li>
  <li>Working software is the principal measure of progress</li>
  <li>Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace</li>
  <li>Close, daily cooperation between businesspeople and developers</li>
  <li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)</li>
  <li>Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted</li>
  <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</li>
  <li>Simplicity</li>
  <li>Self-organizing teams</li>
  <li>Regular adaptation to changing circumstances</li>
</ul><br>
Agile methods break a task into small increments with minimal planning, and do not directly involve long-term planning. Iterations are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from 1- 4 weeks. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly. Stakeholders produce documentation as required. An iteration may not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration.  Multiple iterations may be required to release a product or new features.
<br><br>
<b>TDD</b><br>

TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.<br>

Test-driven development calls for test-first programming style. This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests after the code is written: it makes the developer focus on the requirements before writing the code, a subtle but important difference.<br>


Test-driven development offers more than just simple validation of correctness, but can also drive the design of a program. By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality will be used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to Design by Contract as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.<br>

Because no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path.<br>

It is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and  refactoring.   What is the primary goal of TDD?  One view is the goal of TDD is specification and not validation.  In other words, it's one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code (implying that TDD is both an important  agile requirements and  agile design technique).  Another view is that TDD is a programming technique, the goal of TDD is to write clean code that works.<br><br>

<b>BDD</b><br>
BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read. Behavior-driven developers use their native language in combination with the ubiquitous language of domain driven design to describe the purpose and benefit of their code. This allows the developers to focus on why the code should be created, rather than the technical details, and minimizes translation between the technical language in which the code is written and the domain language spoken by the business, users, stakeholders, project management, etc.<br>
